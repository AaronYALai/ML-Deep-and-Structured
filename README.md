Implementation about 
- Deep Neural Network: Maxout(generalization of ReLU) activation function, Softmax output layer, Cross entropy cost function, Dropout technique, and Momentum optimizations to train a DNN to classify phonemes.  
- Recurrent Neural Network: (working on it) Use RNN/LSTM and RMSProp/NAG to improve the results of DNN just trained. 
- Structured learining.
